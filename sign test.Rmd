This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
# Load the Data
controlled <- read.csv('/Users/Frank/Desktop/projects/project 7/Controlled.csv')
experiment <- read.csv('/Users/Frank/Desktop/projects/project 7/Experiment.csv')
```

```{r}
# Defind variables for testing
grosscon = controlled$Enrollments
grossexp = experiment$Enrollments
netcon = controlled$Payments
netexp = experiment$Payments

```

```{r}
# Perform the sign test day by day
library(BSDA)
for (i in 1:23) {
  #Calculate the gross conversion difference
  grossratecon[i] = grosscon[i]/controlled$Clicks[i]
  grossrateexp[i] = grossexp[i]/controlled$Clicks[i]
  grossratedif[i] = grossratecon[i] - grossrateexp[i]
  
  #Calculate the net conversion difference
  netratecon[i] = netcon[i]/controlled$Clicks[i]
  netrateexp[i] = netexp[i]/(experiment$Clicks[i])
  netratedif[i] = netratecon[i] - netrateexp[i]
  
  
  #Samples = data[1:i]
  #SIGN.test(Samples, conf.level=0.95)
}





```
